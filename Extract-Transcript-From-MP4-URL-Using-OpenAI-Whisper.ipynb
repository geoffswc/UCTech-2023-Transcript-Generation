Keep on winning. Like smoking. We all know the reason he's not to. But out here comes up. That's when we meet the real decision. And for us, it's not for a mom. And that's not even the hardest decision I've ever made. I mean, you know? So how about a little kind of purchase? My parents. They always think I'm not listening. I hear them. Wait a minute. You know, every day you have to deal with stuff on your own. So you want to know why I've decided not to smoke? Which reason would you like? I don't think to smoke to prove myself. My coolness is not on trail here. I don't smoke because sometimes it's what you don't do. That makes you who you are. These are the kids that I hang out with. They're all cool in different ways, but we're a lot of light, too. Because you know, we all deal the same stuff, same decisions, like smoking. Forget it. We all keep up with the same answer. Not for us. We don't have to smoke to be different. Being ourselves is enough. Hey guys, can I ask you a couple of questions? Have you ever tried cigarettes? Nope. What about this? I don't know. I just never wanted to. Really? Yeah, I mean, some of my friends shot at it or whatever. Somebody had a pack at the school, you know, they're smoking on whatever. And do you think they tried to get other people doing it? Yeah, yeah. But that's dumb though. You see what I'm saying? I mean, the reason I did stuff, not they're not dumb, but... That's the stupid reason to do anything. I think. I think. Take it easy. Hey you. Me? Yeah. Did you ever try cigarettes? Almost 14. Any reason? I guess I was trying to be cool or something. Really? Well, yeah. So you tried it because other people were doing it? Yeah, I guess. And why don't you do it anymore? A lot of reasons. I just didn't like it, you know? I don't need to smoke like fit in. Hold up. We finished?\""
