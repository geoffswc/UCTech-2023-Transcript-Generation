# UCTech-2023-Transcript-Generation

This repository contains the code and presentation material for "Bias and Data Loss Through Transcript Generation" at UCTech 2023.

This repository is minimally documented, as tutorials and supporting documents for workshops on this topic are available on the CLE and other Github Repositories.

# Tutorial material

If you'd like a better documented walk-through for how to use the speech-to-text APIs used in this presentation, see the UCSF Library workshop repo:
https://github.com/geoffswc/GCP-Auto-AI-Workshop

## Note

If you're interested in transcribing video rather than audio, you may prefer to use the VideoIntelligence API, which doesn't require processing a .flac file.
The repository for this is current hosted internally on ucsf's internal github, though I plan to create a public version of this repo soon.
